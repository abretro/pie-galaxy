# Pie Galaxy

Pie Galaxy is a GOG client package for RetroPie and other GNU/Linux distributions. It uses [Wyvern](https://github.com/nicohman/wyvern/) to download and [Innoextract](https://github.com/dscharrer/innoextract) to extract games. Pie Galaxy also provides a user interface navigable by game controllers and will install games in such a way that it will use native runtimes. It also uses Wyvern to let you claim games available from [GOG Connect](https://gog.com/connect).

Pie Galaxy does not support every game but intends to support most.  It is not feature complete, and is provided without warranty.  Use at your own enjoyment/peril/risk.

## Contribution

There are a number of ways you can contribute.

For regular users, please file bug reports if you find any bugs. Please put in as much detail as you can, including RetroPie version, pi hardware version, and if possible a verbatim capture of the error message, where a copy of the text is preferred to a png of the error.

. If you want to learn how Github works, maybe you can open a pull request fixing any typos in the documentation. :D

For technical users, maybe you can contribute to the exceptions list.  I also welcome pull requests to the code base, code reviews, and even pull requests that are nothing more than a clearer comment.

If you feel the need to give a monetary contribution, the only thing I have a heart to accept are GOG.com gifts.  If you seriously want to do a monetary contribution, you can contact me on [reddit/u/sigb](https://reddit.com/u/sigb), if you want me to work on a specific game, maybe we can do some basic information gathering before spending any money to check the feasability of getting it to work.
